# Segmentation and Clustering (Focus on stuyding neighborhoos in Toranto Canada)

```
This capstone project course gave me of what data scientists go through in real life when working with data.

1. I learn about location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare. 
2. I also learn how to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in 
different neighborhoods around the world. 
3. I also learn how to be creative in situations where data are not readily available by scraping 
web data and parsing HTML code. 
4. Utilize Python and its pandas library to manipulate data, which will help you refine your skills 
for exploring and analyzing data. 
5. Use the Folium library to great maps of geospatial data and to communicate your results and findings.
